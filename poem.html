								<p> In your arms was still delight,<br>
							Quiet as a street at night;<br>
                            And thoughts of you, I do remember,<br>
                            Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,<br>
                            Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.<br>
                            Love, in you, went passing by,<br>
                            Penetrative, remote, and rare,<br>
                            Like a bird in the wide air,<br>
                            And, as the bird, it left no trace<br>
                            In the heaven of your face.<br>
                            In your stupidity I found<br>
                            The sweet hush after a sweet sound.<br>
                            All about you was the light<br>
                            That dims the greying end of night;<br>                            
                            Desire was the unrisen sun,<br>
                            Joy the day not yet begun,<br>
                            With tree whispering to tree,<br>
                            Without wind, quietly.<br>
                            Wisdom slept within your hair,<br>
                            And Long-Suffering was there,<br>

                            Undiscerning Tenderness.<br>
                            And when you thought, it seemed to me,<br>
                            Infinitely, and like a sea,<br>
                            About the slight world you had known<br>
                            Your vast unsconsciousness was thrown . . . <br>
                            O haven without wave or tide!<br>
                            Silence, in which all songs have died!<br>
                            Holy book, where hearts are still!<br>
                            And home at length under the hill!<br>
                            O mother quiet, breasts of peace,<br>
                            Where love itself would faint and cease!<br>
                            O infinite deep I never knew,<br>
                            I would come back, come back to you,<br>
                            Find you, as a pool unstirred,<br>
                            Kneel down by you, and never a word,<br>
                            Lay my head, and nothing said,<br>
                            In your hands, ungarlanded;<br>
                            And a long watch you would keep;<br>
                            And I should sleep, and I should sleep!

								<p>Roaming the planet, enjoying the sight<br>
                                Wasn't searching for love but I still got lost,<br>

                                Around your warm heart were layers of frost.<br></p>

								<h2>Journals</h2>
								<p><em>Carl and Ellie</em></p><p>The video shows the whole cycle from the beginning of love to the end, loss of love. It contains love from different ages, yet their loves and dream never changes. Their love was unchanged, and their hope from young age were about to become realistic. However, at the end, their dreams could not be fulfilled due to old age. Carl opens himself up to love someone, which makes him more vulnerable and hurts him more. Love may be forever and unchanging, but loss cannot be avoided. Each one can alter your life and consume you. Before the wife dies, she passes on her dreams of adventure.<br><br></p>

								<p><em>Beverly Eckret</em></p><p>The first and foremost thing I would want to say is that I love them. It gets really awkward if i tell them upfront, however, it is the most essential thing to say. Second thing would be thanking them, and expressing gratitude for all their actions they have done for me. I would also want to say apologize for any mistakes or hurtful actions I have done, and say sorry. I want to share my private secrets and open up to my loved ones.<br><br></p>

								<p><em>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</em></p><p>In the story, the characters have difficulty in describing what love is. They use stories as an example, however, nobody can actually define ”love” in words. Terri tries to make a joke, but nobody understands and instead gets annoyed by it. The whole story is about four characters explaining love in their own definition and experience. In this process, a conflict arises when each character has their own interpretation of love. Another conflict would be the “messed up” relationship between Terri and her ex-husband. Mel does not understand Terri’s action of caring her ex-husband until his death. Their ideas of love constantly clashes during the discussion.<br><br></p>

								<p><em>Quote</em></p><p>The quote said by Nelson Mandela states that no one is born with hatred. I agree that people learn to hate others as they grow up. A new-born baby can not hate a random race or religion. People learn way of hating as they grow up. However, the same way a person learn how to hate others, people can also learn the way to love others. I agree his ideas of the following statement, but I disagree that love is more natural than hate.<br><br></p>

								<p><em>Lost Loved Ones</em></p><p>Because of how important emotions are, moving is extremely difficult. It becomes easier as our lives continue. Time heals but never enough. I want to talk to the last girl that walked away with a piece of my heart. I hope she is happy because i almost am. We moved on with our lives, and all we were is now a distant memory. But as a friend, I want to talk to her, and catch up with a companion who had my back once upon a time.
I would ask about where she was, because I’m still here. Did she settle down, or was she still exploring the world? What happened to us? Did I change or did she get bored? I wish she could hear me. I’d be glad to listen to her again.<br><br></p>

								<p><em>Sacrifice</em></p><p>I saw her, alone, crying, midnight. She was hurt, vulnerable. I could’ve gone back to sleep and ignored her calls for help. But I stayed awake, calmed her down, and talked out her feelings. She needed help so I didn’t let go. I forced her to stay and offered her ice cream. I made her sleep in my bed, and I slept on the floor. It felt cold and hard, but it felt right. It was for her. She was worth the night.<br><br></p>
                                
                                <p><em>Effective Altruism</em></p><p>Peter Singer meant to say that you need a heart to feel empathy for those who are suffering, and a head to make sure what you do is effectively helping them. Yes, I agree to this idea, and it appeals to me. For example, there is no use of giving money to starving African child. If you are willing to help, you need to find a method that would directly improve the quality of child’s life. Through his speech, I came across the fact that there are lot of organizations in world’s community to help those in need. The speech showed another perspective of love, which is empathy towards strangers.<br><br></p>
                                
                                <p><em>4321 Min-Chau Le</em></p><p>The author, Adriene Minh-Chau Le, writes her mom’s story from what she has come to know. The author’s mom became a refugee after South Vietnam fell and she had to flee. Her journey is one about sacrifice and struggle, but also hope. The author/daughter recounts it in context to her life and believes she can never equal all that her mother did. The loss and suffering allowed the author to have more appreciation for her life and her mother’s action. The mother fled for she wanted to live and love a little longer. Her actions are considered courageous by the author.
“But how can I ever truly understand what you have lived through, or what it means for me to inherit this history.”
“You talk about your life in the refugee camp with a kind of fondness.”<br>
When I came to Saudi Arabia, I got depression for the first time. Moving to a new place is quite difficult, especially when you cannot control the circumstances. Because I went through the experience with my brother, we became closer. Travelling changes you.</p>
